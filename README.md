# CPU-scheduling-simulation
trace done - stats to be implemented

Algorithms Implemented so far

1. FCFS
2. RR "testcases passed: 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d"
3. SPN
4. SRT "testcases passed: 5a, 5c, 5b, 5d"


NOTES:

1. stats function needs modifications in white spaces
2. WE NEED TO AUTOMATE TESTS SOMEHOW
